Below is a concise overview of four principal focus areas (“IFF” themes) the UN is supporting in Africa for 2024, followed by key challenges and gaps.

1) Data-Driven Governance and Planning (Theme: Governance & Accountability)  
   • Interventions include harmonizing administrative data systems, collecting sex-disaggregated statistics, and distributing climate information (e.g., pluviometers, rainfall bulletins) to guide evidence-based policies.  
   • By improving real-time data use and monitoring, governments can better shape development strategies and respond more effectively to local needs.

2) Strengthening Health Systems (Theme: Health Systems)  
   • Focuses on updating TB/HIV guidelines, scaling up HIV self-testing and differentiated service delivery models, and incorporating WHO recommendations into national plans.  
   • The aim is to expand coverage, especially for vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations, and ensure treatment regimens remain current and equitable.

3) Education and Skills Development (Theme: Education Access)  
   • Emphasizes curriculum reform, remote or digital learning methods, and capacity-building of teachers and trainers (e.g., through TOT workshops).  
   • These efforts seek to boost learning outcomes from early childhood through adulthood and equip youth with career-oriented skills.

4) Economic Empowerment and Innovative Financing (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
   • Includes supporting cross-border trade under ECOWAS & AfCFTA, bolstering enterprise creation, and exploring new financial mechanisms (e.g., Zakat) to fund the SDGs.  
   • Gender-responsive approaches to climate-smart agriculture, plus capacity-building for investment attraction, form key components of sustaining long-term, inclusive growth.

Potential Challenges or Gaps in Support (2–3 sentences):  
While these initiatives are wide-ranging, consistent and sustained financing often remains a challenge, particularly for scaling successful pilot programs to national or regional levels. Coordination across ministries and stakeholders can be difficult, which may limit the long-term impact of capacity-building activities. Additionally, reaching remote or marginalized communities and ensuring technology or data systems remain functional in fragile contexts continue to pose significant hurdles.
