1) Inclusive Access and Quality (Education Access):  
   Many UN interventions focus on expanding equitable, high‐quality education at all levels—especially pre‐primary and primary—through actions like training teachers, constructing or rehabilitating classrooms, improving WASH services in schools, and ensuring vulnerable groups (refugees, out‐of‐school youth, mobile pastoralists) can enroll. Efforts also target stronger sector coordination and planning, including formulating policies and strategic plans that guide more inclusive learning environments.

2) Skills Development and Employment Readiness (Economic Empowerment):  
   Programming supports both formal and non‐formal education systems to equip youth and adults with market‐relevant skills—through vocational training, STEM initiatives, and accelerated learning programs—to drive economic diversification. Initiatives include teacher training in life skills education and the promotion of child‐friendly, career‐oriented approaches at secondary and tertiary levels to strengthen employability.

3) Gender Equality and Comprehensive Sexuality Education (Health and Protection):  
   A significant emphasis is placed on Comprehensive Sexuality Education, prevention of teenage pregnancy, and policies supporting girls’ continued schooling—often through “zero pregnancy” campaigns in schools and men‐engagement strategies in tertiary education. Programmes also address gender‐based violence, toxic masculinity, and support second‐chance education and STEM access for girls, aiming to create safer, more equitable learning environments.

4) Climate Change Awareness and Resilience (Environment and Climate Action):  
   Numerous initiatives integrate climate change content into curricula—both formal and informal—to build a generation of environmentally conscious learners with practical knowledge of mitigation and adaptation. These efforts involve campaigns, training workshops for government officials and educators, and advocacy for gender‐responsive climate funding mechanisms.

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
   Despite these broad efforts, insufficient funding and limited human resource capacity in many education systems pose serious implementation challenges. Additionally, socio‐cultural barriers—especially around girls’ education—and conflict‐affected or humanitarian contexts can disrupt progress. Coordination complexities among multiple stakeholders, including various ministries and donor agencies, further complicate alignment and sustainability of interventions.
