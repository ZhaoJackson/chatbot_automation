Below is a synthesized overview based on the 2024 UN programming entries for Africa:

1) Combating Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants (Theme: Human Rights & Social Protection)  
   • Illustration: Many actions focus on dismantling transnational criminal networks involved in human trafficking and migrant smuggling, providing victim-centered support, and strengthening the legal framework (e.g., GLO.ACT initiatives, capacity building for law enforcement and judiciary).  

2) Preventing Illicit Financial Flows and Strengthening Anti-Corruption Mechanisms (Theme: Governance & Accountability)  
   • Illustration: Interventions include training judicial and penitentiary institutions on money laundering and asset forfeiture, technical assistance to recover stolen assets, and supporting anti-corruption bodies to promote transparency and accountability at all levels.

3) Controlling Illicit Arms and Strengthening Border Management (Theme: Peace & Security)  
   • Illustration: Efforts target capacity-building for law enforcement to detect, mark, and destroy illicit small arms and light weapons as well as improve container control at ports and border posts (e.g., OPEN ROADS III operation), contributing to reduced cross-border organized crime.  

4) Tackling Illicit Exploitation of Natural Resources (Theme: Environmental Sustainability & Resource Management)  
   • Illustration: Actions across multiple countries involve preventing wildlife trafficking, illegal resource extraction, and related financial crimes. For example, there is regional cooperation in the CEEAC to address wildlife crime and efforts to develop strategies to combat the illicit exploitation of resources.

Potential Challenges or Gaps in Support:  
Limited resources, weak legislative frameworks, and insufficient coordination among national and regional actors hamper the response to illicit activities. Governance and oversight bodies often require more robust capacity to investigate and prosecute complex crimes. Inadequate data sharing and technological constraints can also slow detection and cooperation efforts.
