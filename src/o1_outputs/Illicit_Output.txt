Below is a concise overview of four overarching areas where the UN is providing support in Africa to address illicit activity, followed by a brief note on potential challenges and gaps:

1) Combatting Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling  
   • Theme: Social Protection & Human Rights  
   • Illustration: Efforts center on dismantling transnational criminal networks, strengthening national legislation, and improving victim assistance programs. Projects also include training law enforcement and judicial actors to identify, protect, and support survivors.  

2) Tackling Illicit Financial Flows and Corruption  
   • Theme: Governance & Accountability  
   • Illustration: Support includes enhancing anti-corruption mechanisms, strengthening oversight bodies, and building capacity on areas such as money laundering detection, asset recovery, and financial data analysis. Initiatives also help national authorities develop transparent frameworks to manage recovered assets.  

3) Addressing Illicit Trafficking of Goods (Drugs, Arms, Wildlife, and Natural Resources)  
   • Theme: Peace & Security  
   • Illustration: Activities involve cross-border operations and training to detect and disrupt illegal trafficking networks. Emphasis is placed on container control, border management measures, and specialized skills (such as wildlife crime investigations) to reduce illicit flows into and out of the region.  

4) Building Institutional and Community Capacity  
   • Theme: Capacity Building for Sustainable Development  
   • Illustration: This includes comprehensive trainings for law enforcement, judiciary, and community organizations, alongside awareness-raising campaigns and support for investigative journalism. The aim is to foster multi-stakeholder collaboration and resilient local structures that can sustain anti-illicit measures over time.  

Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited resources and technical capacity often hamper the effective implementation of new laws or advanced detection tools. Cross-border collaboration remains uneven, making it difficult to address transnational issues comprehensively. Additionally, corruption and weak accountability mechanisms undercut progress and can limit the sustainability of UN-supported initiatives.
