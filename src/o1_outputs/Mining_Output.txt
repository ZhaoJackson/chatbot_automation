1) Four Main Areas of Focus for Mining in Africa (2024):

• Formalizing Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASMs)  
  Theme: Economic Empowerment  
  Illustration: The UN supports formalization efforts (e.g., ASM activities in Jos) that help small-scale miners operate lawfully, access financing, and adhere to fair labor practices. This fosters local economic growth and mitigates risks associated with unregulated mining.

• Adopting National Mine Action Standards  
  Theme: Safety & Security  
  Illustration: By promoting national regulations and guidelines for landmine/ERW clearance, the UN helps ensure consistent, high-quality demining procedures. These standards also bolster public safety and protect communities from explosive hazards.

• Strengthening Coordination and Capacity for Anti-Mine Action  
  Theme: Governance & Institutional Strengthening  
  Illustration: The UN works with governments and specialized groups to develop working groups or clusters that centralize efforts, share resources, and streamline demining initiatives. This coordination reduces duplication of efforts and improves overall effectiveness.

• Risk Education and Community-Based Mine Action Initiatives  
  Theme: Community Resilience and Protection  
  Illustration: Through accredited organizations, the UN supports awareness campaigns and trainings that teach community members how to recognize and report explosive threats. Such outreach empowers locals to adopt safer behaviors and build collective resilience.

2) Potential Challenges or Gaps:
Despite progress, key gaps remain in ensuring sustained funding, technical expertise, and robust coordination among national and regional stakeholders. Remote or conflict-affected areas often lack reliable data on mine contamination, making it hard to prioritize and measure impact. Moreover, formalizing artisanal mining can be complex due to limited enforcement capacity, inconsistent regulatory frameworks, and deep-rooted informal practices.
