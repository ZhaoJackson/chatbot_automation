1) Strengthening Data and Evidence-Based Governance (Governance & Data)  
   • Illustration: UN support includes harmonizing real-time administrative data systems (with sex- and gender-disaggregated information) to improve planning and decision-making, as well as distributing meteorological instruments (e.g., pluviometers) and publishing agricultural bulletins for local producers.

2) Enhancing Health Services with a Focus on HIV and TB (Health Systems)  
   • Illustration: Interventions range from updating HIV prevention research agendas and TB guidelines based on new WHO recommendations, to scaling up differentiated HIV testing and treatment models (including self-testing) for youth and key populations left behind.

3) Expanding Access to Education and Skills Development (Education Access)  
   • Illustration: Activities encompass remote and digital training-of-trainers workshops, radio and TV-based curricula dissemination, and overarching policy reforms to strengthen assessment capacities and improve learning outcomes for all age groups.

4) Promoting Economic Empowerment and Innovative Financing (Economic Empowerment)  
   • Illustration: Support focuses on raising awareness of cross-border trade opportunities under ECOWAS and AfCFTA, examining mechanisms such as Zakat as an innovative source of SDG financing, and strengthening governance frameworks to spur entrepreneurship and climate-smart agriculture.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite these targeted efforts, limited financial and human resources often constrain the rollout of projects—especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas. Fragmented data systems and uneven coordination across sectors make it difficult to replicate or scale successful interventions. Socio-cultural barriers also persist in areas like HIV disclosure, gender equality, and access to education, requiring sustained advocacy and community engagement.
