1. Four Main Areas of Focus

• Inclusive and Equitable Access to Education (Theme: Education Access)  
  Illustrative Focus: The UN supports national ministries and local authorities to strengthen early learning, primary, and secondary education—particularly for out-of-school children, refugees, and pastoralist communities—through classroom construction, accelerated learning programs, and child-friendly school initiatives.

• Skills Development and Economic Opportunities (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  Illustrative Focus: Programs emphasize linking formal and non-formal education to employment, upgrading STEM education, and providing financial education so that youth, especially women, gain market-relevant skills and better economic prospects.

• Gender Equality and Sexual and Reproductive Health Education (Theme: Gender Equality & Health)  
  Illustrative Focus: Initiatives range from comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in schools and teacher training to targeted engagement of men about harmful gender norms, ensuring girls and young women can access and complete their education free from violence or discrimination.

• Climate Change and Environmental Education (Theme: Environmental Sustainability)  
  Illustrative Focus: Curricula and training programs integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation, raising awareness among youth and policymakers, and empowering communities to adopt sustainable practices.

2. Potential Challenges or Gaps  
Overall, budgets for the social sectors often remain insufficient, making it hard to scale up key initiatives like climate education, CSE, or infrastructure expansion. Coordination among ministries, donors, and implementing partners can be fragmented, hampering oversight and consistent policy implementation. In addition, cultural barriers and limited technical capacity can restrict girls’ participation and the inclusion of newer topics (like climate change) in formal and non-formal schooling.
