1) Digital Economy (Economic Empowerment)  
   • Focus: Strengthening digital and financial inclusion, creating digital job platforms, and empowering small businesses (including youth- and women-led ventures) through alternative lending, market information systems, and e-commerce. These initiatives support diversified production, innovation, and improved access to finance for marginalized populations.  

2) Digital Education (Education Access)  
   • Focus: Introducing and expanding e-learning platforms (e.g., digital curricula for preschool, primary, vocational, and higher education), digital libraries, and online resources. These efforts seek to reduce barriers to quality education, particularly in remote areas and for vulnerable learners.  

3) Digital Governance (Institutional Reforms and Service Delivery)  
   • Focus: Supporting e-justice and digitization of court systems, assisting immigration authorities to implement e-visa solutions, promoting digital mechanisms for participatory urban planning, and building government capacity for digital administration. By streamlining digital services, governments aim to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability.  

4) Digital Health (Health Systems Strengthening)  
   • Focus: Digitalizing health information systems (including maternal and child healthcare data), scaling up proven health innovations, and expanding telehealth infrastructure. These activities help improve health service delivery, strengthen health data management, and increase equitable access to healthcare.  

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
• Many communities still face limited internet penetration, inadequate infrastructure, and inconsistencies in electricity and connectivity, hindering widespread adoption of digital services.  
• Digital literacy gaps, particularly among women, youth, and marginalized groups, hamper full benefit from e-services and limit uptake of online learning opportunities.  
• Regulatory and policy frameworks may not yet be fully adapted to new digital realities, slowing integration of financial and technological innovations across sectors.
